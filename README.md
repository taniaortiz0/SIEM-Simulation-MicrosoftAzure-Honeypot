![List of Resource Groups](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e3704d4-e7c8-43ca-9538-410b3ba76ed3)

Created a list of Resources for the SOC Lab involving a Resource group to store Azure services such as Windows 10 VM, Virtual network, Log Analytics workspace, and Microsoft Sentinel. 

![Allowing any ports access](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74e0e276-9066-4360-8de0-f0163d769c5b) After creating the list of resources, I then configured the Network security group to allow any ports in to see the amass of incoming traffic.
